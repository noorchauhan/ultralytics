# YOLO on Axelera Voyager SDK

You've trained and exported your YOLO model -- these examples show how to build
complete inference pipelines around it using `axelera-runtime2`.

The typical workflow has two phases:

1. **Model preparation.** You use Ultralytics, PyTorch, and the Voyager SDK
   compiler to train, export, and compile your model to `.axm` format.
2. **Application development.** You build your video pipeline and business
   logic using only `axelera-runtime2` -- a lightweight, self-contained
   package with minimal dependencies.

**Why a pipeline SDK?** A real application does more than run a model -- it
reads camera or video frames, preprocesses them, runs AIPU inference, and
postprocesses the results. The runtime fuses all of these stages into a
single optimized pipeline, giving you high end-to-end FPS with low CPU
overhead.

```python
pipeline = op.seq(
    op.colorconvert('RGB', src='BGR'),  # OpenCV reads BGR; models expect RGB
    op.letterbox(640, 640),
    op.totensor(),
    op.load("yolo26n-pose.axm"),
    ConfidenceFilter(threshold=0.25),   # custom operator — see below
    op.to_image_space(keypoint_cols=range(6, 57, 3)),
).optimized()                           # runtime fuses ops for maximum throughput

poses = pipeline(frame)                 # frame in, results out
```

## Examples

We have written three examples, ordered from simple to advanced. It should be straightforward for you to repurpose them for other models and tasks.

| Script | Task | Model |
|--------|------|-------|
| `yolo26-pose.py` | Pose estimation — 17 COCO keypoints | YOLO26n-pose (NMS-free) |
| `yolo26-pose-tracker.py` | Pose estimation + multi-object tracking | YOLO26n-pose (NMS-free) |
| `yolo11-seg.py` | Instance segmentation | YOLO11n-seg |

**Suggested reading order:**
1. **`yolo26-pose.py`** -- Start here. Linear `op.seq()` pipeline with a custom operator.
2. **`yolo11-seg.py`** -- Branching with `op.par()` for multi-head models (detections + masks).
3. **`yolo26-pose-tracker.py`** -- Adds stateful `op.tracker()` for multi-object tracking.

## Installation

If you followed the [Axelera integration guide](../../docs/en/integrations/axelera.md), `axelera-runtime2` is already installed — running `yolo predict` or `yolo val` with an Axelera model auto-installs the runtime dependencies. If you need to install manually:

```bash
pip install axelera-rt==1.6.0rc2 --no-cache-dir --extra-index-url https://software.axelera.ai/artifactory/api/pypi/axelera-pypi/simple
```

You will also need `opencv-python` and `numpy` (likely already present).

## Compile Your Model

Export and compile your trained model directly to Axelera format using the Ultralytics CLI:

```bash
yolo export model=your-model.pt format=axelera
```

To reproduce these examples, export the pretrained Ultralytics models:

```bash
yolo export model=yolo26n-pose.pt format=axelera
yolo export model=yolo11n-seg.pt  format=axelera
```

The compiled models are written to `yolo26n-pose_axelera_model/` and
`yolo11n-seg_axelera_model/` respectively. Pass the `.axm` file inside to `--model`.

## Usage

### Pose Estimation (YOLO26)

```bash
python yolo26-pose.py --model yolo26n-pose.axm --source 0           # webcam
python yolo26-pose.py --model yolo26n-pose.axm --source video.mp4   # video
python yolo26-pose.py --model yolo26n-pose.axm --source image.jpg   # image
```

### Pose Tracking (YOLO26 + TrackTrack)

```bash
python yolo26-pose-tracker.py --model yolo26n-pose.axm --source video.mp4
python yolo26-pose-tracker.py --model yolo26n-pose.axm --source 0 --tracker bytetrack
```

### Instance Segmentation (YOLO11)

```bash
python yolo11-seg.py --model yolo11n-seg.axm --source 0
python yolo11-seg.py --model yolo11n-seg.axm --source video.mp4 --conf 0.3 --iou 0.5
```

### Arguments

| Argument | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `--model` | *required* | Path to compiled `.axm` model |
| `--source` | `0` | Image path, video path, or webcam index |
| `--conf` | `0.25` | Confidence threshold |
| `--iou` | `0.45` | NMS IoU threshold *(segmentation only)* |
| `--tracker` | `tracktrack` | Tracking algorithm: `bytetrack`, `oc-sort`, `sort`, `tracktrack` *(pose-tracker only)* |

## Custom Operators

The pipeline is fully composable — drop in your own operators anywhere in the sequence.
Just subclass `op.Operator` and implement `__call__`:

```python
class ConfidenceFilter(op.Operator):
    threshold: float = 0.25

    def __call__(self, x):
        # Each operator receives the output of the previous one in op.seq().
        # Here x is the output of the pose detection model — an array of
        # shape (batch, num_detections, num_values) where each row holds
        # [bbox, confidence, class_id, keypoints…]. Column 4 is the
        # confidence score. Squeeze the batch dim and filter by score.
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[0]
        return x[x[:, 4] >= self.threshold]
```

When the pipeline has multiple branches — like the segmentation example — `op.par()`
produces a tuple. Use `op.itemgetter()` and `op.pack()` to route each branch, and
unpack the final result at the call site:

```python
detections, masks = pipeline(frame)
```

The runtime treats custom operators as first-class citizens alongside the built-in ones.

## Multi-Object Tracking

Multi-object tracking (MOT) is essential for production applications -- people counting,
cross-line detection, activity analysis, and re-identification. Axelera provides high-performance
C++ tracker implementations behind `op.tracker()` for maximum throughput. Adding tracking
to any detection or pose pipeline is a single line:

```python
pipeline = op.seq(
    # ... your detection or pose pipeline ...
    op.tracker(algo='tracktrack'),   # one line adds tracking
)
```

### Supported Algorithms

| Algorithm | Key Strength | Reference |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| TrackTrack | Iterative matching with track-aware NMS (SOTA) | CVPR 2025 |
| ByteTrack | Handles low-confidence detections via dual threshold | Zhang et al., ECCV 2022 |
| OC-SORT | Observation-centric re-update + virtual trajectory | Cao et al., CVPR 2023 |
| SORT | Simple, fast IoU-only baseline | Bewley et al., ICIP 2016 |

### Detection Correlation (Accessing Keypoints, Masks, or Other Metadata)

The tracker operates on bounding boxes, but the original detection (with all its metadata)
is preserved via `tracked.tracked`. This is the key pattern for associating tracker IDs
back to keypoints, segmentation masks, or any multi-head model output:

```python
for t in tracked_poses:
    print(f"Track {t.track_id}:")
    print(f"  Predicted bbox: {t.predicted_bbox}")

    # Access the original PoseObject -- keypoints are preserved
    pose = t.tracked                   # the original PoseObject
    for kp in pose.keypoints:
        print(f"  {kp.name}: ({kp.x:.0f}, {kp.y:.0f}) conf={kp.confidence:.2f}")

# With return_all_states=True, use latest_det_id to check for active matches:
#   t.latest_det_id >= 0  -> active match (original PoseObject with keypoints)
#   t.latest_det_id == -1 -> lost/removed track (synthetic DetectedObject, no keypoints)
```

By default (`return_all_states=False`), only active tracks are returned -- `tracked.tracked`
is always the original detection. With `return_all_states=True`, use
`tracked.latest_det_id >= 0` to distinguish active matches from lost tracks (which have a
synthetic DetectedObject without keypoints or masks).

This pattern works for **any** detection type: pose (keypoints), segmentation (masks), or
custom multi-head models. Use `tracked.latest_det_id` for O(1) index lookup into the
original detection list.


### Deep-OC-SORT / ReID

OC-SORT includes a full Deep-OC-SORT implementation with appearance embedding support
(parameters: `w_assoc_emb`, `aw_enabled`). To explore ReID integration with Ultralytics
models, see the [Ultralytics ReID documentation](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/object-re-identification-re-id)
and the [Voyager SDK](https://github.com/axelera-ai-hub/voyager-sdk).

## Visualization

These examples use OpenCV drawing for simplicity and zero extra dependencies.
For production applications, the Voyager SDK provides a **high-performance display system**:

- **Multiple rendering backends** -- OpenCV, OpenGL, and headless console
- **`.draw()` on every result type** -- `PoseObject.draw()`, `TrackedObject.draw()`,
  `SegmentedObject.draw()` handle all rendering automatically
- **Production features** -- configurable label formats, per-class colors,
  performance speedometers, multi-stream tiling, and video/image output

See the [Voyager SDK](https://github.com/axelera-ai-hub/voyager-sdk) for the
display system documentation and production pipeline examples.

## Preview Release

> `axelera-runtime2` is currently in **preview / experimental** status. APIs may change
> between releases, and we are actively improving inference performance and expanding
> supported model coverage.

Coming soon:

- **Operator fusion** -- The runtime's fusion system (`.optimized()`) is in its early
  stages. It already fuses basic operator chains, but coverage will expand significantly
  in upcoming releases to reduce memory passes and CPU overhead further.
- **Batching and streaming** -- Fully utilize all AIPU cores for even higher throughput.
